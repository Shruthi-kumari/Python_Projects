1.Drowsiness Detection System

To run the Drowsiness Detection System project in Python, you need to download the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file, which is used for facial landmark detection. This file is crucial for tracking facial features like eyes, mouth, and other key landmarks that are essential for detecting drowsiness based on eye closure or other indicators.
